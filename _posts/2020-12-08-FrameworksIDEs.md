Endless setting up of LiveCode and Android Studio. Android Studio took an hour to get the resolution right, LiveCode deploy seems to be working now though. At around 6 pm I took a break, came home, checked my phone and realized today is GitHub Universe Day - and I attended. 

While most of the content was way beyond my current level there were a couple of interesting discussions and questions answered, I've taken notes and will surely be looking at them in the future. I've also been provided links and some insight into the development study. 

Ended the day by went back and fixed dna.py from CS50 and while it was easier for sure, I had misunderstood the main problem which wasn't to count the amount of dna sequences within the long string but to count the ones who repeat the most times CONSECUTIVELY. 

Classic, non-native speaker mistake.
