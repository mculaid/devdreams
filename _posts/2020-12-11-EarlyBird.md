Today started off by waking a little bit earlier than yesterday, I did not want to spend the whole day sleeping in and thus went to bed a little bit earlier which didn't pose to be a problem since I was dead tired from working anyway. We met for a walk and had our meeting, discussing some design steps, logic but we were also able to understand each other a little bit better. 

There has been changes made to the workflow of the app which I will have to go through but at this point it's almost 5 pm and I guess today is the day I'm taking a break. I don't know whether I will turn productive in the hours to come but as I'm still feeling quite drained, probably because my sleep rythm is suffering a little, I will probably do something else that is related to programming but won't require as much focus. 

I have put some thought into future education and what my odds are and what direction I should pursue. As it stands now, I could be permitted entry to a college if I were to do 3 separate exams (Math, German, Politics/Law) since I do have a vocational degree and I qualify for that. It would take me one year however and would require full time attendance of several courses and learning at home and while I don't mind the studying part I have to ask myself how do I finance that? 

There is ways of course but the question remains .. do I really want to study and nailing these exams is basically just the entry into a College/University. Another minimum of 3 years would follow until a BA and thus I'm 4 years away from a Bachelor of Science if I work really hard but at that point that is a lot of time.. and I'd much prefer to start putting my skills to good use before seeing as how others learn most of their skills on the job.

An alternative would be to do the exam elsewhere but that would take 2 years instead of just one and, time being of kind of the essence, I'll decide this the moment the application process of the prior mentioned Software Development course goes throug. If I make it, I will be a nostrified developer by March 2022 and by that time, I will have spent so much time using the tools availble today, that I will probably already be at the level of a grad student who is fresh out of college. And at that point, it wouldn't really matter as much that I didn't take the school route because the end goal is always the same: Work in Tech. Interesting, how I didn't say I want to be a coder... well.. food for thought. I don't just want to know Syntax, I want to know it all.
