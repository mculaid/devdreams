It was the year of the COVID crisis, specifically in September, when I decided that I wanted more from life. I was working at a gas station at the time and simply had grown disillusioned by the perspective that job offered. I knew from the get-go that my future would have to do something with IT but it wasn't until some time passed that I decided to tackle programming and set myself the goal to become a developer. 

With no prior experience or another specific plan other than to apply for a scholarship which application deadline was the 18th October, I quit my job and started preparing. Working during the crisis was especially taxing on me personally aswell as physically. Still, at the time I did not complain, months passed before i even opened my mouth and at the point I did, it was clear to me that no matter how much effort I put in, I wouldn't ever see the end of it. So I decided that if I'm gonna work hard, I might aswell work hard for my own good. 

In November, I attended a short, Python introductory course irl which consisted of 3 consecutive Saturdays, all Online, a total of 18 hours. Day 2 consisted of lists  (a pretty basic principle in C[array]) so I slacked off. The fact that they are all dynamic though as opposed to C where each array is of a fixed size. A lot of less work for anyone working with arrays.

On another note, before that Python course even began, on the day before, I had successfully translated all of my previous C programs, including the pyramid script, to Python. And while I had spent a good three weeks on most of of these programs in C, translating them all to Python took a mere 2 hours. It was at this point that I realized that in reality, programming depends more on understanding computer stuff and applying logic to it than simply learning some Syntax. My progress in Python was the same as in C.
