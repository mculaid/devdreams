Several days have passed since this site went live. It was the weekend and some more days. Today is Monday and what better time to get back to learning?

### The past week.

I am at were I pretty much left it when I took the splunge into getting my website online. While I originally planned to make web design a reward on it's own it quickly grew into a lot of hours of making decisions and bug-fixing. I stumbled over accidental CSS accidents which turned out to be looking awesome and inspirational. For example, one faulty edit had left my navigational menu at the top unhinged, where at the lowest Window size it would be right atop the actual content (if you can call it that lol) but upon resizing the window to bigger proportions, it would 'slide' to the right. It literally looked as if you were opening a book. And while that bug was slightly amazing and I was able to reproduce it I doubt that giving user the opportunity to resize windows for book-opening galore holds much value, let alone what would happen if one were to maximize the browser - from their perspective the website might just be misaligned unintentionally. But I am drifting off. Clearly, these few hours with CSS have left a lasting impression. But I digress as I often do.

### CS50 Weekly

Before I dived into the GitHub machinery and Reverie, I left CS50 at the start of Week 4, halfway across the current lecture about Memory. I was halfway through it but coming back to it now almost feels like I'm already too late and while I remember a bunch of the topics covered, I think I have to re-watch the first half aswell. I already know this weeks problem sets and I already know what the solution might incorporate, it's just going to be the steps in actual coding that might provide me with a time-sink. And yet, I feel more confident than with last week (Algorithms), now we are going to cover Memory, how C accesses these locations and the tools it uses to do so. This weeks problem set is going to be turning a photograph black and white and being on the more creative side of things, I can personally relate. Turning pictures monochrome is such a basic functionality these days which up until I started CS50 never really questioned, I simply accepted it as reality or "the status quo" so to speak. 

### There is no spoon.

Diving deeply into scientific topics can be exhausting but currently I feel more like I'm a Alice-White Rabbit situation. A few weeks back, when I learned how binary actually works, it's pretty basic I know, myself and my kitchen wall - we had a moment. I stared at my wall for a couple of minutes the least for maybe if I stared long enough, I would begin seeing 1s and 0s. And I did see them, part imagination, part realization. The fact that all the colors produced on my screen are a bunch of digits still is mind-boggling.  On the funnier side, it made me understand that final scene from 'The Matrix' - where Neo dies the first time - that much better. I mean, he dies, he wakes up, sees the world for what it really is (spoiler: a computer program) and proceeds to kick Agent butt (in an extremely satisfying manner which I can only describe as uber). 

Just in case anybody calls me crazy for trying to interpret what my kitchen wall is telling me, I have Artwork hanging there. Other than the simplistic plain white, it's got lots and lots of beautiful colors. Like FF0000.

### Today.

Got some catching up to do. 50 minutes of lecture first half and another hour or so for the second half. Then the shorts which are extremely informative, going over the most important aspects of the lesson while also providing some insight into how one could approach the problem set at hand. Optimally I finish this one quickly because the topic memory manipulation is way to fascinating.
