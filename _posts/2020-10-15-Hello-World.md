After a couple of days familiarizing myself with and editing css-files, after hours of inspecting the same elements of my own website over and over, changing values as I go along and experimenting with what they actually do or can do, we are live!

### Baby steps.

Hello, my name is **mculaid**, I am an aspiring dev currently learning the basics of programming and Computer Science at Harvard's *CS50* via an online course over at edX.

With increasing difficulty of the course problem sets (psets are like tests at the end of each lesson), I found myself working rather hard and also hitting walls here and there and for the effort I have put in so far, I have decided to reward myself. And what better reward than to learn something new?

### The past.

Web Design has always held a certain appeal to me, ever since when I was little and had made a couple of websites about Son-Goku and whatnot in HTML. These sites or 'homepages' as we would call them, were visited by friends, were added to old school toplists of fansites but were generally speaking rather niche. 

Build them was so much fun, I remember that I never worried about anything and never felt frustration with any feature but rather quickly I had exhausted the limits of html. I remember having over 20 sections about different kinds of topics, ranging from the history of my favorite Dragon Ball characters to their different Saiyan states and powerlevels but at the time, database backend was rocket science to me. I don't even know if calling it backend was even a thing then. So what started out as a fan project, quickly rose to out of my reach, simply because, whenever I made a change anywhere or fixed a type-o, I had to manually make changes to each individual page again. The menus were problematic in this scenario. MySQL would have been the go-to solution but instead I used framesets, putting the navigation menu in a different window and it was loaded at the same time as the index page. 

I don't think framesets are even used anymore in this age, nowadays it's all about programming languages like Python. And that is what interests me the most these days. 

### The Goals.

The goal is to land a job as a developer, the path is learning how to be one. And I'm at it. I'm actually applying for an internship/mentorship as we speak. Education and studying for a year are included and paid, afterwards a secure job awaits me. That is if I nail the application process. Having learnt from the past and to what level good preparation influences career prospects, I have several back up plans. I even have a Plan F, where F stands for literally working my butt off in a braindead corporate job just like what happened to that guy in 'Fight Club'. The movie is so 1999 but it's narrowing the gap to real life with each passing year.

Plan F is never going to happen to me but the idea of having zero prospects acts as a catalyst. It's a placeholder and an option, albeit not a viable one because afterall, life is a bunch of choices and you can't just choose between living your absolute dream on one hand and living that other dream where instead of the castle at your private resort you have "just" a mansion at a private beach. These materialistic examples are just me trying to explain why choice has to exist. Instead, we always choose the solution that's feels more ideal to us. A Plan F has to exist, even if only as a placeholder variable because without variables there can be no equation.

### Blogging.

The Blog. It's here to allow me to make notes of where I am going and how I'm achieving my goals. It's here to capture the journey of improving life and the steps I have taken and will take towards making my dream reality.

And I'm done writing, pushing this one so I can get back to my studies!
