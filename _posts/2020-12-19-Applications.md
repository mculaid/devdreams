The last couple of days have been intense. On Wednesday, we received the information that from now on it was hunting season and that we should have our phones ready in case we received a call from a company. At the same time it was clear to me that in order to actually be able to attend uni, I would have to apply to a lot of companies in a short amount of time.

I cleaned up my linkedin immediately after, uploaded a bunch of documents and put some info in there. It was all a bit chaotic. I also made some updates to my repositories and let it all sink in. On Thursday night, I started writing a lot of applications.

Friday evening, the Austrian chanchellor informed us that another Covid-related lockdown was to be put in place as of the 26th December.

There is 60 applicants and 25 seats at uni, my chances went from asking a lot of me to asking a whole lot more. I spent almost the whole of Friday and Thursday on applications aswell as reaching out to recruiters of companies I'd feel interested in working with. Juggling three things, studies, application and working on an actual program I'd say one of these things doesn't have a future. Currently I'm at peak efficiency managing these three but I sure hope it will be over rather sooner than later because I prefer to have a social life on the side too.

On the bright side, I've made progress with the app. After a crunch which lasted much longer than I would admit (practically re-writing the whole engine), I now have what was originally 4 windows condensed into two but built in even more functionality. I even changed the workflow diagram itself and practically halved it's size, moving a couple of checks around and coming up with an idea for rudimentary hardware-verification (licensing).

Reaching the limits with our exisiting database tables I've added a couple of columns since I realized that what we have now isn't sufficient to store everything in orderly fashion. But it's clear to me now that there will be a lot more changes need to be made until I'm satisfied and unless I want to re-write the whole app later on the database is of number one importance now. I'll have to look at inter-linking values between tables and come up with something that's similar to how a linked list in C would function. A linked list.. and a 'next->' ...Huh..
