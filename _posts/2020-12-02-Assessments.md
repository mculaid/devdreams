I had a group assessment regarding my application today. Our task was to come up with a glove company in about 30 minutes. Although it wasn't perfect I have to say I really liked what we came up with in the short time frame. Everybody participated and was pretty cool and I'm really looking forward to meeting either of the participants again in the future.

Today a friend also offered me to work on a commercial app which he is developing from ground up. The framework in use is LiveCode. I do not like the Syntax I've seen so far very much as it's very abstract from the usual programming languages but I'm curious to see what I can do with it.

The day ended with me uploading a video of myself which took around 400 takes after which I was so tired I took the one take I liked the most and literally one of three where I made it through two minutes in one go with the least mistakes made. I'm not usually the type to upload videos about myself but it sure was a fun experience.
