I'm writing this on the 13th at around 3pm which still is morning for me. I cleaned up a little and am letting the coffee sink in. Yesterday night was insane. I met up with a couple of people, my mom brought me cookies (yey!) and it wasn't until around 4 pm that I started. Furthermore, my second monitor arm arrived aswell and I had a nice talk with the delivery man who happened to be a Masters student from my home country, who happened to live in Austria for 4 years already but still couldn't get a proper, academical job. He was extremely nice about it and told me he intends to quit next week anyway. 
As far as programming is concerned, I have access to the MySQL database my friend had created for me. There were 3 tables. I knew that tables are basically as you would expect from an Excel file. But that was literally all I knew. I was provided with a tool called Dbeaver which I launched one time, looked at what the database consists off and then launched the mySQL Docs in Firefox. The docs were all about the queries though and I decided it was time console time.

After some fiddling around for an hour I realized how I could look at specific tables and their contents. My friend sent me messages implying that if I had questions I could ask. I didn't have them. The tables were clearly formatted in a way that would allow me to quickly grasp what's part of the Front End, what's tied to our app and what is going to be the index to search for users. I asked what our Backend on the Website would be, I was told it would be a Wordpress Ecommerce pack. And I looked at that first and searched for ways to implement mySql into Wordpress. 
For reasons I looked at Python first but after around half an hour of research I understood that in order to implement a registration prompt to write new users I would have to use PHP. There were several steps within the app that I could not approach because registration on the Front End/Backend was exactly what was missing. 

Since I had nothing to go on I took it upon myself, downloaded a Wordpress Starter Pack, intending to upload it to my assigned Webspace. But after an hour of fiddling I just realized while he had assigned webspace to me he had not actually given me access to the web, meaning, I could upload files but not access them from outside of the web platform. lol. I tried a bunch of workarounds and while  I could access some specific files via the browser address (despite not having a domain name or anything to go with) but ultimately I always end up with a forbidden.

So I signed up for a free hosting service. Until I finally managed to connect via ftp, Malwarebytes spit out that the host is blocked due to malicious activity. Google turned up nothing apart from a couple of posts on the website. An hour lost. So I went to 000webhost. and after having to jump through some hoops because their platform is more aimed at beginners, I had to use Chrome since my cookies on Firefox were blocked because I hit Enter twice while typing in my password upon first login. There, within the platform I uploaded my WordpressTemplate.zip and proceeded to unpack it. Only that unpacking process didn't work and would give me error messages. 

I tried to switch folders to no avail. Alright, fair enough. So I downloaded Filezilla intending to ftp this stuff. During FileZilla (OpenSource btw!) installation, Malwarebytes popped me with an AdWare warning. I knew this FileZilla setup was "sponsored" but with all the fond memories of how well it worked then I felt bummed by this and cancelled. 

Looked for an alternative and found WinSCP instead and finally connected to my 000webhost ftp. I tried to upload the unpacked Wordpress Folder which would take literally 10 minutes but somewhere in between, I got errors that a file couldn't be unpacked. Fine, I thought. But that wasn't the only one. By the time the upload was at 80 % I simply cancelled it and put in the .zip instead which uploaded in mere seconds. Lol. Fine, unpack in ftp? Not possible. Assign winrar-unpack.exe as an editor to workaround that? Nope. Go to platform and unpack? Nope, same error as before, doesn't let me unpack.

FINE. So I deleted the whole bunch of files I had created and gave in and let 000webhost set me up with Wordpress automatically. At this point 2 or more hours must have passed for sure. Only then could I start looking at php tutorials. In fact, in order to setup a registration form I would need an page.html and a process.php.

 I uploaded those into the public_html folder and tested that out by accessing the page directly through my browser. Turns out I hadn't even needed that Wordpress garbage. Finally, some progress. I could now parse name, email and a message from the user in html and let php process it.
But now I needed a way to take that data and put it in our mySql database.

I was still on 000webhost at this point so I figured I could create a free database (they allow for 2) and manipulate that until I get it right and then switch to our database. Since this wasn't my first foreign into 000webhosting I would like to mention that my last account was compromised in the last leak which happened around I think it was 2014 but I'm not sure anymore. I take it I cannot truly trust my database creditentials to be safe up there and decided against even putting them in. I would just trial my error myself in this closed platform until I found a way to apply my solution to my own data. And I did. I found the solution.

So now, I would have to execute my php script in a safe way. I downloaded php and tried with the in-built php-server. Despite that I added filepaths to the enviroment etc., CMD simply wouldn't work with it properly and while I could start php-servers by using the exact php.exe path, I could not access the server at all and had no way of telling which folder it was actually hosting. I tried another php iteration to no avail and then looked for something that would work out of the box and find luck with "Laragon" which allows just that.

Laragon works like a charm. I deactivated Apache from the settings and launched my server. Finally, I could process all of my stuff online and experiment with our own database. Now, a lot of time passed.

With a lot of trial and error and after exactly 6 hours since I had begun this process, I finally managed to do so. I was extremely proud of myself

This is the screenshot I took the moment my process.php accessed and wrote to our database. I needed all of that...
I took a break to think about my success (that feeling was exciting btw!) and then returned to working. I launched LiveCode and proceeded to do what I was initially up for. I now had a working base to go on. So I programmed my first Login function which basically parses the database and compares the user-id to e-mail and thus allowing login. I felt so badass.

As it turns out LiveCode has some decent use for that lol. Another 4 hours or so passed and I was already feeling like this was the end of my flow. I hadn't actually slept for more than 4 hours so it was insane that I would even function in these 20 hours of which I spent 10 with work. 

I quickly updated my readmes, wrote down a couple of steps and directions I could take for the other database tables. Since I now had registering working, I could now let users logon and the next steps would involve parsing some data like filepaths in another mask. But more on that another time. I also spent some time on trying to import a time_stamp the to database or even create one but I hit a wall there. I also hit a wall in trying to setup an account_id for indexing the users apart from user_id but to no avail.
