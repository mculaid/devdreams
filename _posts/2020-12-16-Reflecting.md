Today is about habits and reflecting. I started it off with a meeting. 

The attendees went over our progress and covered what were to be changed about the database in the future and what tasks lie ahead of me specifically. I seized the opportunity to ask the questions about my current applet and got all the answers I needed. 

Working through will require a bit of tweaking on my side and combining some functions into one but I see no more issues currently. I'm also extremely cheerful for some reason, music playlist from the eighties and nineties only makes it better. 

After a couple of changes made I've condensed 3 masks into once, leaving me with only 2 now but I think we will need at least 3 as I also want to cover users who have forgotten their login info and security of the app itself aswell as a friendly user interface are our top priorities currently.

I'm super pumped about finalizing my applet prototype and am looking forward to new challenges.
