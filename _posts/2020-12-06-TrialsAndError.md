Figuring out a solution to search my database. While the output does provide me with the dataset I'm searching for, it also is inefficient. For example, what if I want partial matches? What if I type in Alex. I don't want to just find Alex but also Alexandra, Alexis and every other abbreviation of the name. It appears to me that I'm circling around the same problem over and over again: Match two or more strings partially. No matter what approach I take with json files and it is the same for each and every script I've written so far, I always hit the same wall. This might be a root problem I will have to figure out first.

Hours later.. Lots of research on Google, lots of information seeking. Stumbled upon an IDE that's supposed to do cross-platform and it's developer company sits half an hour away. Installed the tool but overall sketchy appearance. Proceeded to fiddle about with the built-in LIVE design tool and after it didn't work properly, I googled the developer information, looked up the street on Google images and the company sits in a private apartment building.. the company consists of 2 people of which one is supposedly an MA but I have no intention to verify those Linked.in claims. Wanted to uninstall the tool but the uninstaller wasn't signed by Microsoft and taking a closer look it would actually execute a server file oof. Yeah, no. Removed the program by deleting it manually and proceeded to clean up the registry by getting rid of all the entries I could find. It was stupid of me but the website appeared professional. Also, the tool itself is mostly QT Creator with a little bit of a twist added in, it's just running QT IDE as the main development window lol. Practically running a fork of QT which I'm btw installing as we speak to try out while Malwarebytes is scanning my C: drive in the background lol.

Having given thought to monetization of my friend's app (not one of my tasks) I have come to the conclusion that the only real constant variable in here is preparation time (for the users) for each workshop and the goal of the app is to streamline this process. It's rather simple: It does not matter what the average of attending people is because preparation for what the speakers are doing is roughly the same everytime, therefore, the main appeal of the app is to save the speaker's time.

const preparation time = 10 hours
const workshop time = 3 hours

AVERAGE = data from beta testing period(how many workshops are held? how many attendees?)
An important statistic for monetization could be that if a speaker holds workshops with 20 attendees, the teacher also earns more. Does that mean that the app should cost more? Because clearly the const preparation time factor does not change at all e. g. the teacher doesn't save more time than they would with just one attendee. So should the cost of the app therefore be the same for everyone?

Another thing to factor in is if going by the plan to allow the planning of 3 workshops on average, what about a user who wants to hold 4 in a month? Imagine having to pay way more because you use a program once more. I'd be pissed off.

And a speaker who has 3 weekly lessons with a different group everytime, what's preventing him or her or her from planning a workshop for Monday and using the same sheet on Wednesday and again on Friday?
And if you allow an unlimited account of workshops to subscribers, what's to hold them from pooling their money? And we also have to consider that in a few months down the road, there will be such a thing as a 'perfect' workshop statistic or at least something very close. Are we retaining the right to use this data commercially? Can my friend write a book on the topic? The opportunities are practically endless but so are the risks of security. What if somebody just collects all the data from his or her collagues and put them on the web. In a year or so every workshop worldwide will be the exact same.

To me it appears that monetization of the current project should only be a secondary goal as the user retention and coming up with 'a perfect system' from all of the data collected from the user base and then licensing 'The perfect workshop as a separate entity. The application could be inexpensive and save a lot of time, the perfect workshop on the other hand could be extremely successful.

Really just spitballing ideas here. Monetization does not concern me at all and is not part of my tasks but I'm extremely curious about how this will all turn out.

Thinking about providing them with payperview is an afterthought but paying a couple of Euros everytime you plan a Workshop is kinda stupid and would be annoying to the customer. So you could buy a package instead? At a discount even, maybe? But that only raised further questions. What do you do if someone just wants to trial the program. What about people who don't have Internet, the tool just won't work. 

What about people who just want to mess with settings, should that count towards a planned Workshop? I agree that students should be limited in functionality but they should also be able to fully explore what the app is capable off. 

And on and on it spins, the wheel of questions that need answering. 

Another major problem I see coming about in the far future is, if people start stockpiling their pdfs and statistics, what's holding anyone from selling a stack of them? What's stopping people from sharing their pdfs with their collagues and vice versa? Sooner or later, analyzed data will surface all over the web too and if there is enough data, will somebody be able to break the IP and come up with a reversal process? I think the optimal model should be to focus on web development as it will allow much more control about what's happening with the information and data and only develop apps on the side. Security being of the essence. 

Another option would be to charge speaker's an insane amount to make up for the cost of less profitability over the years unless the outreach of the brand catches on to more users which would kinda equalize the downsides. Lots of thinking about certain questions which only raise more questions. I think 

I feel like I'm slowly beginning to grasp what development from scratch is all about. And boy, I'm excited.
