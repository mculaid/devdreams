A couple of hours of bugfixing aswell as adding some further functions to my applet prototype. The code within the app is getting pretty long witch each passing day. 

Notably I removed a couple of output fields and squeezed them all into one. Login function is now working properly with an md5 hashed password aswell as all entries which should be viewable by the user as far as the workflow diagram is conerned have been updated. I've implemented native .json creating and saving aswell as checking for existing files. 

The in-built json functions() in LiveCode do not appear to work properly and I have helped myself by writing a couple of lines of code and printing characters individually.

I'm about 80 % done and I did not expect that it would this long to come this far  but I'm learning a lot.
When I'm finally done I will have time to finish CS50, the only exams missing are the mySQL lectures which are about parsing finance and movie data. 

I hope it's going to be a cakewalk because the course expires on 1st January 2021 and if I don't finish it by then I will have to repeat a couple of lectures. Not that this is a problem as the course's current iteration is way more advanced and modern (all the lectures are double the length from the previous ones), I'd like to get my certificate beforehand. 

 Working on a actual real world application has it's benefits but I miss the part where I study via a Curriculum.
