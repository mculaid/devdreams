Today I woke up way too late because I was working well into the night of the 9th. We started it off by having a meeting and discussing some viable points while also introducing me to some of the aspects of the world of development. I have been provided a workflow diagram which I spent my day focusing on. 

By iterating over each steps I learned several things and among them how difficult or maybe the better word: complicated it is to track progression on a closed-source framework, especially since LiveCode in the end only provides a single file per stack in which all of the programming is included. A stack could be say, a simple login function, spanning over several different masks or "cards" as they are called in LiveCode. 

On one hand, tracking versions is difficult but on the other hand you sorta have the freedom to use your stacks across different apps at the same time, for example if I have a login function across several pages, I can easily take that stack, and put it in another app I'm making and thus, once I have written a kind of core function, I can use it in whichever way I like. Fascinating, really! But that still doesn't answer version tracking and after going through documentations on the tools I knew by name (Git), I decided to create a directory for my configurator-stack which would contain a readme per mask.
 
All of these readmes are the ONE stack I'm currently working on which has 4-6 masks of which all are covered within each readme. Take for example mask1.md:

Now in case I change anything within the code of the stack itself, I will simply copy-paste it over to the readme. I have also come up with a simple solution to make iterating over the readmes easily. In LiveCode, I created a single window, put the workflow diagram on top and made the masks in the diagram a clickable  button that will open the designated readme.

A couple more hours went into trying to wrap my mind around offline use of Git, how to create a local repository and how to best work on it. 

First, obviously, you have to install Git for Windows (or whatever OS you are operating on), creating a repository on your harddrive is easy, just open your commandline tool of choice, direct it to the folder of your choice (if you are on Windows, you can just type "cmd" into your Windows Explorer address bar and press Enter) via cd and once you have found the folder you want to put your repo in, type 

git --init

into the commandline, which will initialize the folder as a repo and thus git or whatever tool you use will keep track of it's iterations and/or any changes you make. While this worked flawlessly, note: you have to create the folder beforehand either via mkdir in the command line or by simply creating a new folder as you would usually do ;D but some tools (like Git) do allow for the creation of a new folder via the application itself. But not all! Now I don't mind using the command line for a lot of things, most of my scripts also run through the command line and have no GUI but I do prefer the modern approach which is to scour the web and find something useful. 

SourceTree from Atlassian seems to do well for me, I did not have to register a new account or anything since I've already experimented with Trello, Notion and now even Jira which are all products of the Atlassian corp. And all of them are equally good but as a person who doesn't want to share EVERYTHING with the cloud, not because I have something to hide but merely the thought of not knowing where my data goes and who really has access to it, I looked for an alternative Kanban tool at the same time and found a portable, standalone version on Github which is being actively developed.

It's called "cherrytree" and runs across different platforms and saves it's data in a simple database file in sql format, in theory I should be able to take it to any platform I wish but I have to try that out yet. Going by lightweight application I also stumbled over a portable C IDE in form of devcppPortable which is a fully fledged IDE and compiler that I can even put on a thumb drive. Coming back to tracking versions, I have not yet fully understood how should manage my repository. I have tried to clone the repository and a clone functions just as well as the main repo, I can commit and keep track of commits easily but ran into trouble while trying to merge my clone into the main repository. 

A workaround suggested to initialize the original repository via git --init bare, making it a bare repository (whatever that means) but that didn't do the trick either. A separate branch did actually work with merging just fine however I don't know where my alternative branch is even located and how it is related to the master repository in that scenario.

While the merging works, I literally cannot find the location of where it is saved, unlike on Github, where you can access all the files and, what's more important, the history of each individual file. I'd like to have that on Desktop or somewhere (offline, because everything is closed-source) I'm sure there are ways and I hope I will run into problems that will lead me towards finding the answers. I closed up at around midnight, after 8 or so hours where the least time was spent on actually coding. 

I'm not sure if this is what I should be doing but for now .. it just is. I have a good structure with 4 masks and interlinking, aswell as some added functions including the hash checks from an earlier day.
