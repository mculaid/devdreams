Today everything is going well. I've been somewhat offered bonus education for the time until the developer course starts (which is April), long story short I can choose a course I would like to attend but given how very branched everything is right now it would be difficult for me to make the best decision on the spot. I will let this one sit until the end of the year and decide then.

I made my first app in LiveCode today which was just two pictures on two different pages or masks, as they are called in livecode, allowing me to flip inbetween them with a nice visual effect. The pictures I selected where from a random Google search and I got one of Gal Gadot (Wonder Woman) and Sean Connery (needs no introduction)

When the app was done, I selected what I would build it for and that's where LiveCode really shines as it deploys on almost all platforms seemlessly. I had a .exe for Windows, a .app for macOS, an .apk for Android and html5. I don't have the AppleSDK or otherwise could've built for iPhone too.

But seeing how easy and quick the process was I took some time to look through similar frameworks and found out about QT, WPF and HTML/CSS/JavaScript and how those can be used to make applications aswell but obviously there is a lot more on the market (tKinter, pyQT (this one was fun!), JavaFX, Swing and Netbeans. I did not check out all of them in-depth but it sure is nice to have a base going for if I ever want to find more information later.

Just now my custom keycaps arrived. A lot of my keys are all black now :D
