Heavy start. Haven't slept properly and feeling tired. I have integrated and deployed an md5 check via LiveCode which took some time to get working. 

LiveCode's built-in md5 function scrambles everything and in order to turn it into readable output I had to use another unscramble function. I have not fully understood how it works and will have to get back to that later but the app looks good and plays well. Have yet to test it on Android and see if there is anything missing.

My friend has also shared my account data he created for me, I have installed and ran Nextcloud which I've also synced up too.

Afterwards I cleaned up a little, I have my final interview coming up in about 15 minutes form now, have set up the cam and microphone once again. I wish I wasn't this tired, hope it still goes well and I get some more definitive answers.

Later.
The interview is over. As it has been the final stage of everything I will receive a final answer in about a week for now. I asked and it appears my chances aren't bad. 

Alright so, as for the md5 checksum, I realize that calculating md5 is well beyond my current level as it's very complex algorithm and while I could invest a hundred hours in learning about all of it's functions, I had decided to write one in C, I just wrote the main functions, allowing for user input which equals a file pointer e. g. usage filename.txt and included an existing md5 function for C which I had luckily found on github and it works well. 

After some fiddling around it now works with a pre-compiled .exe. Unfortunately I wasn't able to make the program not exit immediately before showing the results and did not want to include a windows library or wait commands so I put scanf there as a placeholder (getchar(); did NOT do the trick for some reason). The user can either type anything they want and press Enter or cancel the program via CTRL + C.
